# agile-final-project
In this project, am playing the roles of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. As a product owner, I have created stories for my team and organize these stories into a product backlog. As a scrum master, I have a created a sprint milestone and make sure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in a sprint plan. As a developer, I have created a sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the Zenhub kanban board in a simulated sprint.
